# Password-manager-app
A password manager app is a software application designed to securely store and manage passwords and other sensitive information. The primary purpose of a password manager is to help users generate, store, and retrieve complex and unique passwords for various online accounts, without the need to remember them all.
I developed a modern password manager application using React.js for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. The frontend UI was styled using Tailwind CSS.
Overall, a password manager is an essential tool for individuals and businesses to enhance security by promoting the use of strong, unique passwords and centralizing password management in a secure and convenient way.
